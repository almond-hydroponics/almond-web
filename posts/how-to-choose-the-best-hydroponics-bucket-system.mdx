	You can use simple buckets to create versatile hydroponic systems. You can
	create a system to grow a few plants at home or thousands of plants in a
	commercial facility. However, there are several types of bucket systems to
	choose from, and making the correct choice is vital to success. In this post,
	we are going to take a look at the different types of bucket systems. We will
	examine their pros and cons so that you can better understand them and choose
	the hydroponic bucket system that best suits your needs.

### The Kratky bucket

<Typography color="text.secondary">
	The simplest system is the Kratky bucket system. In this setup, you have a
	bucket with one or several holes on the lid. You put plants in net pots with
	media and then fill the bucket with a nutrient solution so that it is barely
	touching the bottom of the media. The media initially draws water through
	capillary action, while the roots reach the nutrient solution. After that,
	the roots draw nutrients from the water and an air gap is created between the
	plant and the water as the crop evaporates water. The roots use this air gap
	to get the oxygen they need for respiration. For this reason, you donâ€™t need
	any air pumps.

### The bucket with and air pump

<Typography color="text.secondary">
	The Kratky system has zero power consumption, but does require the grower to
	carefully manage the initial nutrient level and is not very tolerant to
	strong variations in environmental conditions. For this reason, a more robust
	method to grow is the bucket with an air stone. This is exactly the same as a
	Kratky system, except that air is constantly pumped into the nutrient
	solution and the nutrients are generally maintained at a specific level
	inside the bucket.
