### Red wigglers can thrive in hydroponic systems

<br />
<Typography color="text.secondary">
	Our growers always ask if red worms can survive in a recirculating deep water
	culture system using 100% complete hydroponic nutrients. In order to prove
	that they can survive, we put 100 hundred of these little wigglers into 5
	different containers, during the transition that goes from veg to flower.
	During the experiment, these creatures have shown an incredible capacity to
	adapt, survive, and succeed. They were living in the roots, feeding from dead
	root material, reproduce, and grow. They crawl up and down and nothing seemed
	to disturb them, except for light and movement.

	We put 20 worms in a container and immediately they found their way down to
	the roots. In a very short period of time, these 20 worms turned into 65 with
	30 eggs ready to hatch. These creatures are so incredible that they
	transformed the entire root system into a complex structure. For example:
	There is a place for food, a place for eggs, and even for waste. Once they
	reach a certain number of member in the colony, some of them emigrate to
	other containers for space, and those who emigrates are the bigger and
	stronger ones; they live a legacy for the younger generation. It is quite
	fascinating!
