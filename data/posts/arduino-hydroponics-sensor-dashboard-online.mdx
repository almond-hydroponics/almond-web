	For this build, we are going to use an Arduino Wifi Rev2 and an LCD shield
	from DFRobot. For our sensor, we are going to be using these low-cost
	capacitive moisture sensors. This sample project uses only one sensor, but
	you can connect up to five sensors to the LCD shield. Since this project is
	going to be connected to the internet, it requires access to an
	internet-connected WiFi network.

	Additionally, you will also need a free flespi account. Go to the flespi page
	and create an account before you continue with the project. You should select
	the MQTT option when creating your account since the project uses the MQTT
	protocol for transmission. After logging into your account, copy the token
	shown on the “Tokens” page, as you will need it to set up the code.
